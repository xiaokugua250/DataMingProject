hive.execution.engine
Default Value: mr

mapred.reduce.tasks
Default Value: -1
The default number of reduce tasks per job. Typically set to a prime close to the number of available hosts. Ignored when mapred.job.tracker is "local". Hadoop set this to 1 by default, whereas Hive uses -1 as its default value. By setting this property to -1, Hive will automatically figure out what should be the number of reducers.
hive.exec.reducers.bytes.per.reducer
Default Value: 1,000,000,000 prior to Hive 0.14.0; 256 MB (256,000,000) in Hive 0.14.0 and later
Size per reducer. The default in Hive 0.14.0 and earlier is 1 GB, that is, if the input size is 10 GB then 10 reducers will be used. In Hive 0.14.0 and later the default is 256 MB, that is, if the input size is 1 GB then 4 reducers will be used.
hive.exec.reducers.max
Default Value: 999 prior to Hive 0.14.0; 1009 in Hive 0.14.0 and later
Maximum number of reducers that will be used. If the one specified in the configuration property mapred.reduce.tasks is negative, Hive will use this as the maximum number of reducers when automatically determining the number of reducers.
hive.jar.path
Default Value: (empty)
Added In: Hive 0.2.0 or earlier
The location of hive_cli.jar that is used when submitting jobs in a separate jvm.
hive.aux.jars.path
Default Value: (empty)
Added In: Hive 0.2.0 or earlier
The location of the plugin jars that contain implementations of user defined functions (UDFs) and SerDes.
hive.reloadable.aux.jars.path
Default Value: (empty)
Added In: Hive 0.14.0 with HIVE-7553
Jars that can be renewed (added, removed, or updated) by executing the Beeline reload command without having to restart HiveServer2. These jars can be used just like the auxiliary classes in hive.aux.jars.path for creating UDFs or SerDes.
hive.exec.scratchdir
Default Value: /tmp/${user.name} in Hive 0.2.0 through 0.8.0; /tmp/hive-${user.name} in Hive 0.8.1 through 0.14.0; or /tmp/hive in Hive 0.14.0 and later

hive.scratch.dir.permission
Default Value: 700
The permission for the user-specific scratch directories that get created in the root scratch directory. (See hive.exec.scratchdir.)
hive.hadoop.supports.splittable.combineinputformat
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 0.6.0
Whether to combine small input files so that fewer mappers are spawned.
hive.map.aggr
Default Value: true in Hive 0.3 and later; false in Hive 0.2
Added In: Hive 0.2.0
Whether to use map-side aggregation in Hive Group By queries.
hive.groupby.skewindata
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 0.3.0
Whether there is skew in data to optimize group by queries.
hive.groupby.mapaggr.checkinterval
Default Value: 100000
Added In: Hive 0.3.0
Number of rows after which size of the grouping keys/aggregation classes is performed.
hive.new.job.grouping.set.cardinality
Default Value: 30
For a query like "select a, b, c, count(1) from T group by a, b, c with rollup;" four rows are created per row: (a, b, c), (a, b, null), (a, null, null), (null, null, null). This can lead to explosion across the map-reduce boundary if the cardinality of T is very high, and map-side aggregation does not do a very good job.
This parameter decides if Hive should add an additional map-reduce job. If the grouping set cardinality (4 in the example above) is more than this value, a new MR job is added under the assumption that the orginal "group by" will reduce the data size.
hive.mapred.local.mem
Default Value: 0
Added In: Hive 0.3.0
For local mode, memory of the mappers/reducers.
hive.map.aggr.hash.force.flush.memory.threshold
Default Value: 0.9
Added In: Hive 0.7.0 with HIVE-1830
The maximum memory to be used by map-side group aggregation hash table. If the memory usage is higher than this number, force to flush data.

hive.map.aggr.hash.percentmemory
Default Value: 0.5
Portion of total memory to be used by map-side group aggregation hash table.

hive.map.aggr.hash.min.reduction
Default Value: 0.5
Hash aggregation will be turned off if the ratio between hash table size and input rows is bigger than this number. Set to 1 to make sure hash aggregation is never turned off.

hive.optimize.groupby
Default Value: true
Whether to enable the bucketed group by from bucketed partitions/tables.

hive.multigroupby.singlemr
Default Value: false
Removed In: Hive 0.9.0 by HIVE-2621 (see hive.multigroupby.singlereducer)
Whether to optimize multi group by query to generate a single M/R job plan. If the multi group by query has common group by keys, it will be optimized to generate a single M/R job. (This configuration property was removed in release 0.9.0.)

hive.multigroupby.singlereducer
Default Value: true
Whether to optimize multi group by query to generate a single M/R  job plan. If the multi group by query has common group by keys, it will be optimized to generate a single M/R job.

hive.optimize.cp
Default Value: true
Whether to enable column pruner. (This configuration property was removed in release 0.13.0.)

hive.optimize.index.filter
Default Value: false
Whether to enable automatic use of indexes.
Note:  See Indexing for more configuration properties related to Hive indexes.

hive.optimize.ppd
Default Value: true
Whether to enable predicate pushdown (PPD).
Note: Turn on hive.optimize.index.filter as well to use file format specific indexes with PPD.

hive.optimize.ppd.storage
Default Value: true
Whether to push predicates down into storage handlers. Ignored when hive.optimize.ppd is false.

hive.ppd.remove.duplicatefilters
Default Value: true
During query optimization, filters may be pushed down in the operator tree. If this config is true, only pushed down filters remain in the operator tree, and the original filter is removed. If this config is false, the original filter is also left in the operator tree at the original place.

hive.ppd.recognizetransivity
Default Value: true
Whether to transitively replicate predicate filters over equijoin conditions.

hive.join.emit.interval
Default Value: 1000
How many rows in the right-most join operand Hive should buffer before

emitting the join result.
hive.join.cache.size
Default Value: 25000
How many rows in the joining tables (except the streaming table)
should be cached in memory.

hive.mapjoin.bucket.cache.size
Default Value: 100
How many values in each key in the map-joined table should be cached in memory.

hive.mapjoin.followby.map.aggr.hash.percentmemory
Default Value: 0.3
Portion of total memory to be used by map-side group aggregation hash table, when this group by is followed by map join.

hive.smalltable.filesize or hive.mapjoin.smalltable.filesize
Default Value: 25000000
The threshold (in bytes) for the input file size of the small tables; if the file size is smaller than this threshold, it will try to convert the common join into map join.

hive.mapjoin.localtask.max.memory.usage
Default Value: 0.90
This number means how much memory the local task can take to hold the key/value into an in-memory hash table. If the local task's memory usage is more than this number, the local task will be aborted. It means the data of small table is too large to be held in memory.

hive.mapjoin.followby.gby.localtask.max.memory.usage
Default Value: 0.55
Added In: Hive 0.7.0 with HIVE-1830
This number means how much memory the local task can take to hold the key/value into an in-memory hash table when this map join is followed by a group by. If the local task's memory usage is more than this number, the local task will abort by itself. It means the data of the small table is too large to be held in memory.
hive.mapjoin.check.memory.rows
Default Value: 100000
Added In: Hive 0.7.0 with HIVE-1808 and HIVE-1642
The number means after how many rows processed it needs to check the memory usage.
hive.ignore.mapjoin.hint
Default Value: true
Added In: Hive 0.11.0 with HIVE-4042
Whether Hive ignores the mapjoin hint.
hive.smbjoin.cache.rows
Default Value: 10000
Added In: Hive 0.12.0 with HIVE-4440 (replaces hive.mapjoin.bucket.cache.size)
How many rows with the same key value should be cached in memory per sort-merge-bucket joined table.
hive.mapjoin.optimized.keys
Default Value: true
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-6429 and HIVE-6188
Whether a MapJoin hashtable should use optimized (size-wise) keys, allowing the table to take less memory. Depending on the key, memory savings for the entire table can be 5-15% or so.
hive.mapjoin.optimized.hashtable
Default Value: true
Added In: Hive 0.14.0 with HIVE-6430
Whether Hive should use a memory-optimized hash table for MapJoin. Only works on Tez and Spark, because memory-optimized hash table cannot be serialized. (Spark is supported starting from Hive 1.3.0, with HIVE-11180.)
hive.mapjoin.optimized.hashtable.wbsize
Default Value: 10485760 (10 * 1024 * 1024)
Added In: Hive 0.14.0 with HIVE-6430
Optimized hashtable (see hive.mapjoin.optimized.hashtable) uses a chain of buffers to store data. This is one buffer size. Hashtable may be slightly faster if this is larger, but for small joins unnecessary memory will be allocated and then trimmed.
hive.mapjoin.lazy.hashtable
Default Value: true
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-6418 and HIVE-6188
Whether a MapJoin hashtable should deserialize values on demand. Depending on how many values in the table the join will actually touch, it can save a lot of memory by not creating objects for rows that are not needed. If all rows are needed, obviously there's no gain.
hive.hashtable.initialCapacity
Default Value: 100000
Added In: Hive 0.7.0 with HIVE-1642
Initial capacity of mapjoin hashtable if statistics are absent, or if hive.hashtable.key.count.adjustment is set to 0.
hive.hashtable.key.count.adjustment
Default Value: 1.0
Added In: Hive 0.14.0 with HIVE-7616
Adjustment to mapjoin hashtable size derived from table and column statistics; the estimate of the number of keys is divided by this value. If the value is 0, statistics are not used and hive.hashtable.initialCapacity is used instead.
hive.hashtable.loadfactor
Default Value: 0.75
Added In: Hive 0.7.0 with HIVE-1642
In the process of Mapjoin, the key/value will be held in the hashtable. This value means the load factor for the in-memory hashtable.
hive.debug.localtask
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 0.7.0 with HIVE-1642
hive.optimize.skewjoin
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 0.6.0
Whether to enable skew join optimization.  (Also see hive.optimize.skewjoin.compiletime.)
hive.skewjoin.key
Default Value: 100000
Added In: Hive 0.6.0
Determine if we get a skew key in join. If we see more than the specified number of rows with the same key in join operator, we think the key as a skew join key.
hive.skewjoin.mapjoin.map.tasks
Default Value: 10000
Added In: Hive 0.6.0
Determine the number of map task used in the follow up map join job for a skew join. It should be used together with hive.skewjoin.mapjoin.min.split to perform a fine grained control.
hive.skewjoin.mapjoin.min.split
Default Value: 33554432
Added In: Hive 0.6.0
Determine the number of map task at most used in the follow up map join job for a skew join by specifying the minimum split size. It should be used together with hive.skewjoin.mapjoin.map.tasks to perform a fine grained control.
hive.optimize.skewjoin.compiletime
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 0.10.0
Whether to create a separate plan for skewed keys for the tables in the join. This is based on the skewed keys stored in the metadata. At compile time, the plan is broken into different joins: one for the skewed keys, and the other for the remaining keys. And then, a union is performed for the two joins generated above. So unless the same skewed key is present in both the joined tables, the join for the skewed key will be performed as a map-side join.
The main difference between this paramater and hive.optimize.skewjoin is that this parameter uses the skew information stored in the metastore to optimize the plan at compile time itself. If there is no skew information in the metadata, this parameter will not have any effect.
Both hive.optimize.skewjoin.compiletime and hive.optimize.skewjoin should be set to true. (Ideally, hive.optimize.skewjoin should be renamed as hive.optimize.skewjoin.runtime, but for backward compatibility that has not been done.)
If the skew information is correctly stored in the metadata, hive.optimize.skewjoin.compiletime will change the query plan to take care of it, and hive.optimize.skewjoin will be a no-op.
hive.optimize.union.remove
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 0.10.0 with HIVE-3276
Whether to remove the union and push the operators between union and the filesink above union. This avoids an extra scan of the output by union. This is independently useful for union queries, and especially useful when hive.optimize.skewjoin.compiletime is set to true, since an extra union is inserted.
The merge is triggered if either of hive.merge.mapfiles or hive.merge.mapredfiles is set to true. If the user has set hive.merge.mapfiles to true and hive.merge.mapredfiles to false, the idea was that the number of reducers are few, so the number of files anyway is small. However, with this optimization, we are increasing the number of files possibly by a big margin. So, we merge aggresively.
hive.mapred.supports.subdirectories
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 0.10.0 with HIVE-3276
Whether the version of Hadoop which is running supports sub-directories for tables/partitions. Many Hive optimizations can be applied if the Hadoop version supports sub-directories for tables/partitions. This support was added by MAPREDUCE-1501.
hive.mapred.mode
Default Value:
Hive 0.x: nonstrict
Hive 1.x: nonstrict
Hive 2.x: strict (HIVE-12413)
Added In: Hive 0.3.0
The mode in which the Hive operations are being performed. In strict mode, some risky queries are not allowed to run. For example, full table scans are prevented (see HIVE-10454) and ORDER BY requires a LIMIT clause.
hive.exec.script.maxerrsize
Default Value: 100000
Added In: Hive 0.2.0
Maximum number of bytes a script is allowed to emit to standard error (per map-reduce task). This prevents runaway scripts from filling logs partitions to capacity.
hive.script.auto.progress
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 0.4.0
Whether Hive Tranform/Map/Reduce Clause should automatically send progress information to TaskTracker to avoid the task getting killed because of inactivity. Hive sends progress information when the script is outputting to stderr. This option removes the need of periodically producing stderr messages, but users should be cautious because this may prevent infinite loops in the scripts to be killed by TaskTracker.
hive.exec.script.allow.partial.consumption
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 0.5.0
When enabled, this option allows a user script to exit successfully without consuming all the data from the standard input.
hive.script.operator.id.env.var
Default Value: HIVE_SCRIPT_OPERATOR_ID
Added In: Hive 0.5.0
Name of the environment variable that holds the unique script operator ID in the user's transform function (the custom mapper/reducer that the user has specified in the query).
hive.script.operator.env.blacklist
Default Value: hive.txn.valid.txns,hive.script.operator.env.blacklist
Added In: Hive 0.14.0 with HIVE-8341
By default all values in the HiveConf object are converted to environment variables of the same name as the key (with '.' (dot) converted to '_' (underscore)) and set as part of the script operator's environment.  However, some values can grow large or are not amenable to translation to environment variables.  This value gives a comma separated list of configuration values that will not be set in the environment when calling a script operator.  By default the valid transaction list is excluded, as it can grow large and is sometimes compressed, which does not translate well to an environment variable.
Also see:
SerDes for more hive.script.* configuration properties
hive.exec.compress.output
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 0.2.0
This controls whether the final outputs of a query (to a local/hdfs file or a Hive table) is compressed. The compression codec and other options are determined from Hadoop configuration variables mapred.output.compress* .
hive.exec.compress.intermediate
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 0.2.0
This controls whether intermediate files produced by Hive between multiple map-reduce jobs are compressed. The compression codec and other options are determined from Hadoop configuration variables mapred.output.compress*.
hive.exec.parallel
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 0.5.0
Whether to execute jobs in parallel.  Applies to MapReduce jobs that can run in parallel, for example jobs processing different source tables before a join.  As of Hive 0.14, also applies to move tasks that can run in parallel, for example moving files to insert targets during multi-insert.
hive.exec.parallel.thread.number
Default Value: 8
Added In: Hive 0.6.0
How many jobs at most can be executed in parallel.
hive.exec.rowoffset
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 0.8.0
Whether to provide the row offset virtual column.
hive.task.progress
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 0.5.0
Removed In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-4518
Whether Hive should periodically update task progress counters during execution. Enabling this allows task progress to be monitored more closely in the job tracker, but may impose a performance penalty. This flag is automatically set to true for jobs with hive.exec.dynamic.partition set to true. (This configuration property was removed in release 0.13.0.)
hive.counters.group.name
Default Value: HIVE
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-4518
Counter group name for counters used during query execution. The counter group is used for internal Hive variables (CREATED_FILE, FATAL_ERROR, and so on).
hive.exec.pre.hooks
Default Value: (empty)
Added In: Hive 0.4.0
Comma-separated list of pre-execution hooks to be invoked for each statement. A pre-execution hook is specified as the name of a Java class which implements the org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.hooks.ExecuteWithHookContext interface.
hive.exec.post.hooks
Default Value: (empty)
Added In: Hive 0.5.0
Comma-separated list of post-execution hooks to be invoked for each statement. A post-execution hook is specified as the name of a Java class which implements the org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.hooks.ExecuteWithHookContext interface.
hive.exec.failure.hooks
Default Value: (empty)
Added In: Hive 0.8.0
Comma-separated list of on-failure hooks to be invoked for each statement. An on-failure hook is specified as the name of Java class which implements the org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.hooks.ExecuteWithHookContext interface.
hive.merge.mapfiles
Default Value: true
Added In: Hive 0.4.0
Merge small files at the end of a map-only job.
hive.merge.mapredfiles
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 0.4.0
Merge small files at the end of a map-reduce job.
hive.mergejob.maponly
Default Value: true
Added In: Hive 0.6.0
Removed In: Hive 0.11.0
Try to generate a map-only job for merging files if CombineHiveInputFormat is supported. (This configuration property was removed in release 0.11.0.)
hive.merge.size.per.task
Default Value: 256000000
Added In: Hive 0.4.0
Size of merged files at the end of the job.
hive.merge.smallfiles.avgsize
Default Value: 16000000
Added In: Hive 0.5.0
When the average output file size of a job is less than this number, Hive will start an additional map-reduce job to merge the output files into bigger files. This is only done for map-only jobs if hive.merge.mapfiles is true, and for map-reduce jobs if hive.merge.mapredfiles is true.
hive.heartbeat.interval
Default Value: 1000
Added In: Hive 0.4.0
Send a heartbeat after this interval ¨C used by mapjoin and filter operators.
hive.auto.convert.join
Default Value: false in 0.7.0 to 0.10.0; true in 0.11.0 and later (HIVE-3297)
Added In: 0.7.0 with HIVE-1642
Whether Hive enables the optimization about converting common join into mapjoin based on the input file size. (Note that hive-default.xml.template incorrectly gives the default as false in Hive 0.11.0 through 0.13.1.)
hive.auto.convert.join.noconditionaltask
Default Value: true
Added In: 0.11.0 with HIVE-3784 (default changed to true with HIVE-4146)
Whether Hive enables the optimization about converting common join into mapjoin based on the input file size. If this parameter is on, and the sum of size for n-1 of the tables/partitions for an n-way join is smaller than the size specified by hive.auto.convert.join.noconditionaltask.size, the join is directly converted to a mapjoin (there is no conditional task).
hive.auto.convert.join.noconditionaltask.size
Default Value: 10000000
Added In: 0.11.0 with HIVE-3784
If hive.auto.convert.join.noconditionaltask is off, this parameter does not take effect. However, if it is on, and the sum of size for n-1 of the tables/partitions for an n-way join is smaller than this size, the join is directly converted to a mapjoin (there is no conditional task). The default is 10MB.
hive.auto.convert.join.use.nonstaged
Default Value: false
Added In: 0.13.0 with HIVE-6144 (default originally true, but changed to false with HIVE-6749 also in 0.13.0)
For conditional joins, if input stream from a small alias can be directly applied to the join operator without filtering or projection, the alias need not be pre-staged in the distributed cache via a mapred local task. Currently, this is not working with vectorization or Tez execution engine.
hive.udtf.auto.progress
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 0.5.0
Whether Hive should automatically send progress information to TaskTracker when using UDTF's to prevent the task getting killed because of inactivity. Users should be cautious because this may prevent TaskTracker from killing tasks with infinite loops.
hive.mapred.reduce.tasks.speculative.execution
Default Value: true
Added In: Hive 0.5.0
Whether speculative execution for reducers should be turned on.
hive.exec.counters.pull.interval
Default Value: 1000
Added In: Hive 0.6.0
The interval with which to poll the JobTracker for the counters the running job. The smaller it is the more load there will be on the jobtracker, the higher it is the less granular the caught will be.
hive.enforce.bucketing
Default Value:
Hive 0.x: false
Hive 1.x: false
Hive 2.x: removed, which effectively makes it always true (HIVE-12331)
Added In: Hive 0.6.0
Whether bucketing is enforced. If true, while inserting into the table, bucketing is enforced.
Set to true to support INSERT ... VALUES, UPDATE, and DELETE transactions in Hive 0.14.0 and 1.x.x. For a complete list of parameters required for turning on Hive transactions, see hive.txn.manager.
hive.enforce.sorting
Default Value:
Hive 0.x: false
Hive 1.x: false
Hive 2.x: removed, which effectively makes it always true (HIVE-12331)
Added In: Hive 0.6.0
Whether sorting is enforced. If true, while inserting into the table, sorting is enforced.
hive.optimize.bucketingsorting
Default Value: true
Added In: Hive 0.11.0 with HIVE-4240
If hive.enforce.bucketing or hive.enforce.sorting is true, don't create a reducer for enforcing bucketing/sorting for queries of the form:
insert overwrite table T2 select * from T1;
where T1 and T2 are bucketed/sorted by the same keys into the same number of buckets. (In Hive 2.0.0 and later, this parameter does not depend on hive.enforce.bucketing or hive.enforce.sorting.)
hive.optimize.reducededuplication
Default Value: true
Added In: Hive 0.6.0
Remove extra map-reduce jobs if the data is already clustered by the same key which needs to be used again. This should always be set to true. Since it is a new feature, it has been made configurable.
hive.optimize.reducededuplication.min.reducer
Default Value: 4
Added In: Hive 0.11.0 with HIVE-2340
Reduce deduplication merges two RSs (reduce sink operators) by moving key/parts/reducer-num of the child RS to parent RS. That means if reducer-num of the child RS is fixed (order by or forced bucketing) and small, it can make very slow, single MR. The optimization will be disabled if number of reducers is less than specified value.
hive.optimize.correlation
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 0.12.0 with HIVE-2206
Exploit intra-query correlations. For details see the Correlation Optimizer design document.
hive.optimize.limittranspose
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 2.0.0 with HIVE-11684, modified by HIVE-11775
Whether to push a limit through left/right outer join or union. If the value is true and the size of the outer input is reduced enough (as specified in hive.optimize.limittranspose.reductionpercentage and hive.optimize.limittranspose.reductiontuples), the limit is pushed to the outer input or union; to remain semantically correct, the limit is kept on top of the join or the union too.
hive.optimize.limittranspose.reductionpercentage
Default Value: 1.0
Added In: Hive 2.0.0 with HIVE-11684, modified by HIVE-11775
When hive.optimize.limittranspose is true, this variable specifies the minimal percentage (fractional) reduction of the size of the outer input of the join or input of the union that the optimizer should get in order to apply the rule.
hive.optimize.limittranspose.reductiontuples
Default Value: 0
Added In: Hive 2.0.0 with HIVE-11684, modified by HIVE-11775
When hive.optimize.limittranspose is true, this variable specifies the minimal reduction in the number of tuples of the outer input of the join or input of the union that the optimizer should get in order to apply the rule.
hive.optimize.sort.dynamic.partition
Default Value: true in Hive 0.13.0 and 0.13.1; false in Hive 0.14.0 and later (HIVE-8151)
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-6455
When enabled, dynamic partitioning column will be globally sorted. This way we can keep only one record writer open for each partition value in the reducer thereby reducing the memory pressure on reducers.
hive.cbo.enable
Default Value: false in Hive 0.14.*; true in Hive 1.1.0 and later (HIVE-8395)
Added In: Hive 0.14.0 with HIVE-5775 and HIVE-7946
When true, the cost based optimizer, which uses the Calcite framework, will be enabled.
hive.optimize.null.scan
Default Value: true
Added In: Hive 0.14.0 with HIVE-7385
When true, this optimization will try to not scan any rows from tables which can be determined at query compile time to not generate any rows (e.g., where 1 = 2, where false, limit 0 etc.).
hive.exec.dynamic.partition
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 0.6.0
Whether or not to allow dynamic partitions in DML/DDL.
hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode
Default Value: strict
Added In: Hive 0.6.0
In strict mode, the user must specify at least one static partition in case the user accidentally overwrites all partitions. In nonstrict mode all partitions are allowed to be dynamic.
Set to nonstrict to support INSERT ... VALUES, UPDATE, and DELETE transactions (Hive 0.14.0 and later). For a complete list of parameters required for turning on Hive transactions, see hive.txn.manager.
hive.exec.max.dynamic.partitions
Default Value: 1000
Added In: Hive 0.6.0
Maximum number of dynamic partitions allowed to be created in total.
hive.exec.max.dynamic.partitions.pernode
Default Value: 100
Added In: Hive 0.6.0
Maximum number of dynamic partitions allowed to be created in each mapper/reducer node.
hive.exec.max.created.files
Default Value: 100000
Added In: Hive 0.7.0
Maximum number of HDFS files created by all mappers/reducers in a MapReduce job.
hive.exec.default.partition.name
Default Value: _HIVE_DEFAULT_PARTITION_
Added In: Hive 0.6.0
The default partition name in case the dynamic partition column value is null/empty string or any other values that cannot be escaped. This value must not contain any special character used in HDFS URI (e.g., ':', '%', '/' etc). The user has to be aware that the dynamic partition value should not contain this value to avoid confusions.
hive.fetch.output.serde
Default Value: org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.DelimitedJSONSerDe

Added In: Hive 0.8.1 with HIVE-2181
Fixed In:  Hive 1.3.0 with HIVE-10415
To clean up the Hive scratch directory while starting the Hive server (or HiveServer2). This is not an option for a multi-user environment since it will accidentally remove the scratch directory in use.
hive.scratchdir.lock
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 1.3.0 and 2.1.0 (but not 2.0.x) with HIVE-13429
When true, holds a lock file in the scratch directory. If a Hive process dies and accidentally leaves a dangling scratchdir behind, the cleardanglingscratchdir tool will remove it.

Added In: Hive 0.10.0 with HIVE-2848
Enables type checking for registered Hive configurations.
As of Hive 0.14.0 (HIVE-7211), a configuration name that starts with "hive." is regarded as a Hive system property. With hive.conf.validation true (default), any attempts to set a configuration property that starts with "hive." which is not registered to the Hive system will throw an exception.
hive.fetch.task.conversion
Default Value: minimal in Hive 0.10.0 through 0.13.1, more in Hive 0.14.0 and later
Added In: Hive 0.10.0 with HIVE-2925; default changed in Hive 0.14.0 with HIVE-7397
Some select queries can be converted to a single FETCH task, minimizing latency. Currently the query should be single sourced not having any subquery and should not have any aggregations or distincts (which incur RS ¨C ReduceSinkOperator, requiring a MapReduce task), lateral views and joins.
Supported values are none, minimal and more.
0. none:  Disable hive.fetch.task.conversion (value added in Hive 0.14.0 with HIVE-8389)
1. minimal:  SELECT *, FILTER on partition columns (WHERE and HAVING clauses), LIMIT only
2. more:  SELECT, FILTER, LIMIT only (including TABLESAMPLE, virtual columns)
"more" can take any kind of expressions in the SELECT clause, including UDFs.
(UDTFs and lateral views are not yet supported ¨C see HIVE-5718.)
hive.map.groupby.sorted
Default Value:
Hive 0.x and 1.x: false
Hive 2.0 and later: true (HIVE-12325)
Added In: Hive 0.10.0 with HIVE-3432
If the bucketing/sorting properties of the table exactly match the grouping key, whether to perform the group by in the mapper by using BucketizedHiveInputFormat. The only downside to this is that it limits the number of mappers to the number of files.
hive.map.groupby.sorted.testmode
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 0.11.0 with HIVE-4281
Removed In: Hive 2.0.0 with HIVE-12325
If the bucketing/sorting properties of the table exactly match the grouping key, whether to perform the group by in the mapper by using BucketizedHiveInputFormat. If the test mode is set, the plan is not converted, but a query property is set to denote the same. (This configuration property was removed in release 2.0.0.)
hive.groupby.orderby.position.alias
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 0.11.0 with HIVE-581
Whether to enable using Column Position Alias in GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses of queries.
hive.fetch.task.aggr
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 0.12.0 with HIVE-4002 (description added in Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-5793)
Aggregation queries with no group-by clause (for example, select count(*) from src) execute final aggregations in a single reduce task. If this parameter is set to true, Hive delegates the final aggregation stage to a fetch task, possibly decreasing the query time.
hive.fetch.task.conversion.threshold
Default Value: -1 in Hive 0.13.0 and 0.13.1, 1073741824 (1 GB) in Hive 0.14.0 and later
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-3990; default changed in Hive 0.14.0 with HIVE-7397
Input threshold (in bytes) for applying hive.fetch.task.conversion. If target table is native, input length is calculated by summation of file lengths. If it's not native, the storage handler for the table can optionally implement the org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.InputEstimator interface. A negative threshold means hive.fetch.task.conversion is applied without any input length threshold.
hive.limit.pushdown.memory.usage
Default Value: -1
Added In: Hive 0.12.0 with HIVE-3562
The maximum memory to be used for hash in RS operator for top K selection. The default value "-1" means no limit.
hive.cache.expr.evaluation
Default Value: true
Added In: Hive 0.12.0 with HIVE-4209
Bug Fix: Hive 0.14.0 with HIVE-7314 (expression caching doesn't work when using UDF inside another UDF or a Hive function)
If true, the evaluation result of a deterministic expression referenced twice or more will be cached. For example, in a filter condition like "... where key + 10 > 10 or key + 10 = 0" the expression "key + 10" will be evaluated/cached once and reused for the following expression ("key + 10 = 0"). Currently, this is applied only to expressions in select or filter operators.
hive.resultset.use.unique.column.names
Default Value: true
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-6687
Make column names unique in the result set by qualifying column names with table alias if needed. Table alias will be added to column names for queries of type "select *" or if query explicitly uses table alias "select r1.x..".
hive.support.quoted.identifiers
Default Value: column
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-6013
Whether to use quoted identifiers.  Value can be "none" or "column".
column:  Column names can contain any Unicode character. Any column name that is specified within backticks (`) is treated literally. Within a backtick string, use double backticks (``) to represent a backtick character.
none:  Only alphanumeric and underscore characters are valid in identifiers. Backticked names are interpreted as regular expressions. This is also the behavior in releases prior to 0.13.0.
hive.plan.serialization.format
Default Value: kryo
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-1511
Query plan format serialization between client and task nodes. Two supported values are kryo and javaXML. Kryo is the default.
hive.exec.check.crossproducts
Default Value: true
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-6643

hive.display.partition.cols.separately
Default Value: true
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-6689
In older Hive versions (0.10 and earlier) no distinction was made between partition columns or non-partition columns while displaying columns in DESCRIBE TABLE. From version 0.12 onwards, they are displayed separately. This flag will let you get the old behavior, if desired. See test-case in patch for HIVE-6689.
hive.limit.query.max.table.partition
Default Value: -1
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-6492
To protect the cluster, this controls how many partitions can be scanned for each partitioned table. The default value "-1" means no limit. The limit on partitions does not affect metadata-only queries.
hive.files.umask.value
Default Value: 0002
Added In: (none, but temporarily in patches for HIVE-2504 before release 0.9.0)
Removed In: Hive 0.9.0 (HIVE-2504-1.patch), replaced by hive.warehouse.subdir.inherit.perms
Obsolete:  The dfs.umask value for the Hive-created folders.

hive.optimize.sampling.orderby.percent
Default Value: 0.1
Added In: Hive 0.12.0 with HIVE-1402
With hive.optimize.sampling.orderby=true, probability with which a row will be chosen.
hive.compat
Default Value: 0.12
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-6012
Enable (configurable) deprecated behaviors of arithmetic operations by setting the desired level of backward compatibility. The default value gives backward-compatible return types for numeric operations. Other supported release numbers give newer behavior for numeric operations, for example 0.13 gives the more SQL compliant return types introduced in HIVE-5356.
The value "latest" specifies the latest supported level. Currently, this only affects division of integers.
Setting to 0.12 (default) maintains division behavior in Hive 0.12 and earlier releases: int / int = double.
Setting to 0.13 gives division behavior in Hive 0.13 and later releases: int / int = decimal.
An invalid setting will cause an error message, and the default support level will be used.
hive.optimize.constant.propagation
Default Value: true
Added In: Hive 0.14.0 with HIVE-5771
Whether to enable the constant propagation optimizer.
hive.entity.capture.transform

Define the storage policy for temporary tables. Choices between memory, ssd and default. See HDFS Storage Types and Storage Policies.
hive.optimize.distinct.rewrite
Default Value: true
Added In: Hive 1.2.0 with HIVE-10568
When applicable, this optimization rewrites distinct aggregates from a single-stage to multi-stage aggregation. This may not be optimal in all cases. Ideally, whether to trigger it or not should be a cost-based decision. Until Hive formalizes the cost model for this, this is config driven.
hive.optimize.point.lookup
Default Value: true
Added In: Hive 2.0.0 with HIVE-11461
Whether to transform OR clauses in Filter operators into IN clauses.
hive.optimize.point.lookup.min

See Registration of Native SerDes for more information for storage formats and SerDes.
hive.lazysimple.extended_boolean_literal
Default Value: false
Added in: Hive 0.14 with HIVE-3635
LazySimpleSerDe uses this property to determine if it treats 'T', 't', 'F', 'f', '1', and '0' as extended, legal boolean literals, in addition to 'TRUE' and 'FALSE'. The default is false, which means only 'TRUE' and 'FALSE' are treated as legal boolean literals.
I/O
hive.io.exception.handlers
Default Value: (empty)
Added In: Hive 0.8.1
A list of I/O exception handler class names. This is used to construct a list of exception handlers to handle exceptions thrown by record readers.
hive.input.format
Default Value: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.CombineHiveInputFormat

ORC File Format
The ORC file format was introduced in Hive 0.11.0. See ORC Files for details.
Besides the configuration properties listed in this section, some properties in other sections are also related to ORC:
hive.default.fileformat
hive.stats.gather.num.threads
hive.exec.orc.memory.pool
Default Value: 0.5
Added In: Hive 0.11.0 with HIVE-4248
Maximum fraction of heap that can be used by ORC file writers.
hive.exec.orc.write.format
Default Value: (empty)
Added In: Hive 0.12.0 with HIVE-4123; default changed from 0.11 to null with HIVE-5091 (also in Hive 0.12.0)
Define the version of the file to write. Possible values are 0.11 and 0.12. If this parameter is not defined, ORC will use the run length encoding (RLE) introduced in Hive 0.12. Any value other than 0.11 results in the 0.12 encoding.
Additional values may be introduced in the future (see HIVE-6002).
hive.exec.orc.default.stripe.size
Default Value: 256*1024*1024 (268,435,456) in 0.13.0;
                         64*1024*1024 (67,108,864) in 0.14.0
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-5425; default changed in 0.14.0 with HIVE-7231 and HIVE-7490

Default Value: 256*1024*1024 (268,435,456)
Added In: Hive 0.14.0 with HIVE-7231
Define the default file system block size for ORC files.
hive.exec.orc.dictionary.key.size.threshold
Default Value: 0.8
Added In: Hive 0.12.0 with HIVE-4324
If the number of keys in a dictionary is greater than this fraction of the total number of non-null rows, turn off dictionary encoding.  Use 1 to always use dictionary encoding.
hive.exec.orc.default.row.index.stride
Default Value: 10000
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-5728
Define the default ORC index stride in number of rows. (Stride is the number of rows an index entry represents.)
hive.exec.orc.default.buffer.size
Default Value: 256*1024 (262,144)
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-5728
Define the default ORC buffer size, in bytes.
hive.exec.orc.default.block.padding
Default Value: true
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-5728
Define the default block padding. Block padding was added in Hive 0.12.0 (HIVE-5091, "ORC files should have an option to pad stripes to the HDFS block boundaries").
hive.exec.orc.block.padding.tolerance
Default Value: 0.05
Added In: Hive 0.14.0 with HIVE-7231
Define the tolerance for block padding as a decimal fraction of stripe size (for example, the default value 0.05 is 5% of the stripe size). For the defaults of 64Mb ORC stripe and 256Mb HDFS blocks, a maximum of 3.2Mb will be reserved for padding within the 256Mb block with the default hive.exec.orc.block.padding.tolerance. In that case, if the available size within the block is more than 3.2Mb, a new smaller stripe will be inserted to fit within that space. This will make sure that no stripe written will cross block boundaries and cause remote reads within a node local task.
hive.exec.orc.default.compress
Default Value: ZLIB
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-5728
Define the default compression codec for ORC file.
hive.exec.orc.encoding.strategy
Default Value: SPEED
Added In: Hive 0.14.0 with HIVE-7219
Define the encoding strategy to use while writing data. Changing this will only affect the light weight encoding for integers. This flag will not change the compression level of higher level compression codec (like ZLIB). Possible options are SPEED and COMPRESSION.
hive.orc.splits.include.file.footer
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-6125 and HIVE-6128
If turned on, splits generated by ORC will include metadata about the stripes in the file. This data is read remotely (from the client or HiveServer2 machine) and sent to all the tasks.
hive.orc.cache.stripe.details.size
Default Value: 10000
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-6125 and HIVE-6128
Cache size for keeping meta information about ORC splits cached in the client.
hive.orc.compute.splits.num.threads
Default Value: 10
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-6125 and HIVE-6128
How many threads ORC should use to create splits in parallel.
hive.exec.orc.split.strategy
Default Value: HYBRID
Added In: Hive 1.2.0 with HIVE-10114
What strategy ORC should use to create splits for execution. The available options are "BI", "ETL" and "HYBRID".

The HYBRID mode reads the footers for all files if there are fewer files than expected mapper count, switching over to generating 1 split per file if the average file sizes are smaller than the default HDFS blocksize. ETL strategy always reads the ORC footers before generating splits, while the BI strategy generates per-file splits fast without reading any data from HDFS.
hive.exec.orc.skip.corrupt.data
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-6382
If ORC reader encounters corrupt data, this value will be used to determine whether to skip the corrupt data or throw an exception. The default behavior is to throw an exception.
hive.exec.orc.zerocopy
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-6347 and HIVE-6360
Use zerocopy reads with ORC. (This requires Hadoop 2.3 or later.)
hive.merge.orcfile.stripe.level
Default Value: true
Added In: Hive 0.14.0 with HIVE-7509
When hive.merge.mapfiles, hive.merge.mapredfiles or hive.merge.tezfiles is enabled while writing a table with ORC file format, enabling this configuration property will do stripe-level fast merge for small ORC files. Note that enabling this configuration property will not honor the padding tolerance configuration (hive.exec.orc.block.padding.tolerance).
hive.orc.row.index.stride.dictionary.check
Default Value: true
Added In: Hive 0.14.0 with HIVE-7832
If enabled dictionary check will happen after first row index stride (default 10000 rows) else dictionary check will happen before writing first stripe. In both cases, the decision to use dictionary or not will be retained thereafter.
hive.exec.orc.compression.strategy
Default Value: SPEED
Added In: Hive 0.14.0 with HIVE-7859
Define the compression strategy to use while writing data. This changes the compression level of higher level compression codec (like ZLIB).
Value can be SPEED or COMPRESSION.
Parquet
Parquet is supported by a plugin in Hive 0.10, 0.11, and 0.12 and natively in Hive 0.13 and later. See Parquet for details.
hive.parquet.timestamp.skip.conversion
Default Value: true
Added In: Hive 1.2.0 with HIVE-9482
Current Hive implementation of Parquet stores timestamps in UTC on-file, this flag allows skipping of the conversion on reading Parquet files created from other tools that may not have done so.
Vectorization
Hive added vectorized query execution in release 0.13.0 (HIVE-4160, HIVE-5283). For more information see the design document Vectorized Query Execution.
hive.vectorized.execution.enabled
Default Value: false

This flag should be set to true to enable vectorized mode of query execution. The default value is false.
hive.vectorized.execution.reduce.enabled
Default Value: true
Added In: Hive 0.14.0 with HIVE-7405
This flag should be set to true to enable vectorized mode of the reduce-side of query execution. The default value is true.
hive.vectorized.execution.reduce.groupby.enabled
Default Value: true

Added In: Hive 0.8.1 with HIVE-2616, default changed in Hive 0.14.0 with HIVE-6903
In unsecure mode, true will cause the metastore to execute DFS operations using the client's reported user and group permissions. Note that this property must be set on both the client and server sides. Further note that it's best effort. If client sets it to true and server sets it to false, the client setting will be ignored.
hive.metastore.event.listeners

hive.metastore.thrift.framed.transport.enabled
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 0.10.0 with HIVE-2767
If true, the metastore Thrift interface will use TFramedTransport. When false (default) a standard TTransport is used.
hive.metastore.schema.verification
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 0.12.0 with HIVE-3764
Enforce metastore schema version consistency.
True: Verify that version information stored in metastore matches with one from Hive jars. Also disable automatic schema migration attempt (see datanucleus.autoCreateSchema and datanucleus.schema.autoCreateAll). Users are required to manually migrate schema after Hive upgrade which ensures proper metastore schema migration.
False: Warn if the version information stored in metastore doesn't match with one from Hive jars.
For more information, see Metastore Schema Consistency and Upgrades.
hive.metastore.disallow.incompatible.col.type.changes
Default Value:
Hive 0.x and 1.x: false
Hive 2.x and later: true (HIVE-12320)
Added In: Hive 0.12.0 with HIVE-4409
If true, ALTER TABLE operations which change the type of a column (say STRING) to an incompatible type (say MAP<STRING, STRING>) are disallowed. RCFile default SerDe (ColumnarSerDe) serializes the values in such a way that the datatypes can be converted from string to any type. The map is also serialized as a string, which can be read as a string as well. However, with any binary serialization, this is not true. Blocking the ALTER TABLE prevents ClassCastExceptions when subsequently trying to access old partitions.
Primitive types like INT, STRING, BIGINT, etc. are compatible with each other and are not blocked.
See HIVE-4409 for more details.
hive.metastore.integral.jdo.pushdown
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-6052
Allow JDO query pushdown for integral partition columns in metastore. Off by default. This improves metastore performance for integral columns, especially if there's a large number of partitions. However, it doesn't work correctly with integral values that are not normalized (for example, if they have leading zeroes like 0012). If metastore direct SQL is enabled and works (hive.metastore.try.direct.sql), this optimization is also irrelevant.
hive.metastore.try.direct.sql
Default Value: true
Added In: Hive 0.12.0 with HIVE-4051
Whether the Hive metastore should try to use direct SQL queries instead of the DataNucleus for certain read paths. This can improve metastore performance when fetching many partitions or column statistics by orders of magnitude; however, it is not guaranteed to work on all RDBMS-es and all versions. In case of SQL failures, the metastore will fall back to the DataNucleus, so it's safe even if SQL doesn't work for all queries on your datastore. If all SQL queries fail (for example, your metastore is backed by MongoDB), you might want to disable this to save the try-and-fall-back cost.
This can be configured on a per client basis by using the "set metaconf:hive.metastore.try.direct.sql=<value>" command, starting with Hive 0.14.0 (HIVE-7532).
hive.metastore.try.direct.sql.ddl
Default Value: true
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-5626
Same as hive.metastore.try.direct.sql, for read statements within a transaction that modifies metastore data. Due to non-standard behavior in Postgres, if a direct SQL select query has incorrect syntax or something similar inside a transaction, the entire transaction will fail and fall-back to DataNucleus will not be possible. You should disable the usage of direct SQL inside transactions if that happens in your case.
This can be configured on a per client basis by using the "set metaconf:hive.metastore.try.direct.sql.ddl=<value>" command, starting with Hive 0.14.0 (HIVE-7532).
hive.direct.sql.max.query.length
Default Value: 100
Added In: Hive 1.3.0 and 2.1.0 (but not 2.0.x) with HIVE-12349
The maximum size of a query string (in KB) as generated by direct SQL.
hive.direct.sql.max.elements.in.clause
Default Value: 1000
Added In: Hive 1.3.0 and 2.1.0 (but not 2.0.x) with HIVE-12349
The maximum number of values in an IN clause as generated by direct SQL. Once exceeded, it will be broken into multiple OR separated IN clauses.
hive.direct.sql.max.elements.values.clause
Default Value: 1000
Added In: Hive 1.3.0 and 2.1.0 (but not 2.0.x) with HIVE-12349
The maximum number of values in a VALUES clause for an INSERT statement as generated by direct SQL.

Comma-delimited set of integers denoting the desired rollover intervals (in seconds) for percentile latency metrics on the LLAP daemon producer-consumer queue.
By default, percentile latency metrics are disabled.
LLAP UDF Security
Whitelist based UDF support (HIVE-12852).
hive.llap.allow.permanent.fns
Default Value: true
Added In: 2.1.0 with HIVE-13307
Whether LLAP decider should allow permanent UDFs.
hive.llap.daemon.download.permanent.fns
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 2.1.0 with HIVE-12853, HIVE-13054, and HIVE-13307
Whether LLAP daemon should localize the resources for permanent UDFs.
LLAP Security
hive.llap.daemon.keytab.file
The path to the Kerberos Keytab file containing the LLAP daemon's service principal.
hive.llap.zk.sm.principal
The name of the principal to use to talk to ZooKeeper for ZooKeeper SecretManager.

The path to the Kerberos Keytab file containing the principal to use to talk to ZooKeeper for ZooKeeper SecretManager.
hive.llap.zk.sm.connectionString
ZooKeeper connection string for ZooKeeper SecretManager.
Transactions and Compactor
Hive transactions with row-level ACID functionality were added in Hive 0.13.0 (HIVE-5317 and its subtasks). For details see ACID and Transactions in Hive.
To turn on Hive transactions, change the values of these parameters from their defaults, as described below:
hive.txn.manager
hive.compactor.initiator.on
hive.compactor.worker.threads
These parameters must also have non-default values to turn on Hive transactions:
hive.support.concurrency
hive.enforce.bucketing (Hive 0.x and 1.x only)
hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode
hive.txn.manager
Default Value: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.lockmgr.DummyTxnManager
Hive Transactions Value: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.lockmgr.DbTxnManager
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-5843
Set this to org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.lockmgr.DbTxnManager as part of turning on Hive transactions. The default DummyTxnManager replicates pre-Hive-0.13 behavior and provides no transactions.
Turning on Hive transactions also requires appropriate settings for hive.compactor.initiator.on, hive.compactor.worker.threads, hive.support.concurrency, hive.enforce.bucketing, and hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode.
hive.txn.timeout
Default Value: 300
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-5843
Time after which transactions are declared aborted if the client has not sent a heartbeat, in seconds.
hive.timedout.txn.reaper.start
Default Value: 100s
Added In: Hive 1.3.0 with HIVE-11317
Time delay of first reaper (the process which aborts timed-out transactions) run after the metastore start.
hive.timedout.txn.reaper.interval
Default Value: 180s
Added In: Hive 1.3.0 with HIVE-11317
Time interval describing how often the reaper (the process which aborts timed-out transactions) runs.
hive.txn.max.open.batch
Default Value: 1000
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-5843
Maximum number of transactions that can be fetched in one call to open_txns().
This controls how many transactions streaming agents such as Flume or Storm open simultaneously. The streaming agent then writes that number of entries into a single file (per Flume agent or Storm bolt). Thus increasing this value decreases the number of delta files created by streaming agents. But it also increases the number of open transactions that Hive has to track at any given time, which may negatively affect read performance.
hive.compactor.initiator.on
Default Value: false
Hive Transactions Value: true (for exactly one instance of the Thrift metastore service)
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-5843
Whether to run the initiator and cleaner threads on this metastore instance. Set this to true on one instance of the Thrift metastore service as part of turning on Hive transactions. For a complete list of parameters required for turning on transactions, see hive.txn.manager.
It's critical that this is enabled on exactly one metastore service instance (not enforced yet).
hive.compactor.worker.threads
Default Value: 0
Hive Transactions Value: greater than 0 on at least one instance of the Thrift metastore service
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-5843
How many compactor worker threads to run on this metastore instance. Set this to a positive number on one or more instances of the Thrift metastore service as part of turning on Hive transactions. For a complete list of parameters required for turning on transactions, see hive.txn.manager.
Worker threads spawn MapReduce jobs to do compactions. They do not do the compactions themselves. Increasing the number of worker threads will decrease the time it takes tables or partitions to be compacted once they are determined to need compaction. It will also increase the background load on the Hadoop cluster as more MapReduce jobs will be running in the background.
hive.compactor.worker.timeout
Default Value: 86400
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-5843
Time in seconds after which a compaction job will be declared failed and the compaction re-queued.
hive.compactor.check.interval
Default Value: 300
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-5843
Time in seconds between checks to see if any tables or partitions need to be compacted. This should be kept high because each check for compaction requires many calls against the NameNode.
Decreasing this value will reduce the time it takes for compaction to be started for a table or partition that requires compaction.  However, checking if compaction is needed requires several calls to the NameNode for each table or partition that has had a transaction done on it since the last major compaction.  So decreasing this value will increase the load on the NameNode.
hive.compactor.cleaner.run.interval
Default Value: 5000
Added In: Hive 0.14 with HIVE-8258
Time in milliseconds between runs of the cleaner thread.  Increasing this value will lengthen the time it takes to clean up old, no longer used versions of data and lower the load on the metastore server.  Decreasing this value will shorten the time it takes to clean up old, no longer used versions of the data and increase the load on the metastore server.
hive.compactor.delta.num.threshold
Default Value: 10
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-5843
Number of delta directories in a table or partition that will trigger a minor compaction.
hive.compactor.delta.pct.threshold
Default Value: 0.1
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-5843
Percentage (fractional) size of the delta files relative to the base that will trigger a major compaction. (1.0 = 100%, so the default 0.1 = 10%.)
hive.compactor.abortedtxn.threshold
Default Value: 1000
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-5843
Number of aborted transactions involving a given table or partition that will trigger a major compaction.
Indexing
Indexing was added in Hive 0.7.0 with HIVE-417, and bitmap indexing was added in Hive 0.8.0 with HIVE-1803. For more information see Indexing.
hive.index.compact.file.ignore.hdfs
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 0.7.0 with HIVE-1889
When true the HDFS location stored in the index file will be ignored at runtime. If the data got moved or the name of the cluster got changed, the index data should still be usable.
hive.optimize.index.filter
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 0.8.0 with HIVE-1644
Whether to enable automatic use of indexes.
hive.optimize.index.filter.compact.minsize
Default Value: 5368709120
Added In: Hive 0.8.0 with HIVE-1644
Minimum size (in bytes) of the inputs on which a compact index is automatically used.
hive.optimize.index.filter.compact.maxsize
Default Value: -1
Added In: Hive 0.8.0 with HIVE-1644
Maximum size (in bytes) of the inputs on which a compact index is automatically used. A negative number is equivalent to infinity.
hive.index.compact.query.max.size
Default Value: 10737418240
Added In: Hive 0.8.0 with HIVE-2096
The maximum number of bytes that a query using the compact index can read. Negative value is equivalent to infinity.
hive.index.compact.query.max.entries
Default Value: 10000000
Added In: Hive 0.8.0 with HIVE-2096
The maximum number of index entries to read during a query that uses the compact index. Negative value is equivalent to infinity.
hive.exec.concatenate.check.index
Default Value: true
Added In: Hive 0.8.0 with HIVE-2125
If this sets to true, Hive will throw error when doing ALTER TABLE tbl_name [partSpec] CONCATENATE on a table/partition that has indexes on it. The reason the user want to set this to true is because it can help user to avoid handling all index drop, recreation, rebuild work. This is very helpful for tables with thousands of partitions.
hive.optimize.index.groupby
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 0.8.1 with HIVE-1694
hive.index.compact.binary.search
Default Value: true
Added In: Hive 0.8.1 with HIVE-2535
Whether or not to use a binary search to find the entries in an index table that match the filter, where possible.
Statistics
See Statistics in Hive for information about how to collect and use Hive table, partition, and column statistics.
hive.stats.dbclass
Default Value: jdbc:derby (Hive 0.7 to 0.12) or fs (Hive 0.13 and later)

Supported values are fs (filesystem), jdbc:<database> (where <database> can be derby, mysql, etc.), hbase, counter, and custom as defined in StatsSetupConst.java.
hive.stats.autogather
Default Value: true
Added In: Hive 0.7 with HIVE-1361
A flag to gather statistics automatically during the INSERT OVERWRITE command.

The JDBC driver for the database that stores temporary Hive statistics.
hive.stats.dbconnectionstring
Default Value: jdbc:derby:;databaseName=TempStatsStore;create=true
Added In: Hive 0.7 with HIVE-1361
The default connection string for the database that stores temporary Hive statistics.
hive.stats.default.publisher
Default Value: (empty)
Added In: Hive 0.7 with HIVE-1923
The Java class (implementing the StatsPublisher interface) that is used by default if hive.stats.dbclass is not JDBC or HBase (Hive 0.12.0 and earlier), or if hive.stats.dbclass is a custom type (Hive 0.13.0 and later:  HIVE-4632).
hive.stats.default.aggregator
Default Value: (empty)
Added In: Hive 0.7 with HIVE-1923
The Java class (implementing the StatsAggregator interface) that is used by default if hive.stats.dbclass is not JDBC or HBase (Hive 0.12.0 and earlier), or if hive.stats.dbclass is a custom type (Hive 0.13.0 and later:  HIVE-4632).
hive.stats.jdbc.timeout
Default Value: 30
Added In: Hive 0.7 with HIVE-1961
Timeout value (number of seconds) used by JDBC connection and statements.
hive.stats.atomic
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 0.7 with HIVE-1961
If this is set to true then the metastore statistics will be updated only if all types of statistics (number of rows, number of files, number of bytes, etc.) are available. Otherwise metastore statistics are updated in a best effort fashion with whatever are available.
hive.stats.retries.max
Default Value: 0
Added In: Hive 0.8 with HIVE-2127
Maximum number of retries when stats publisher/aggregator got an exception updating intermediate database. Default is no tries on failures.
hive.stats.retries.wait
Default Value: 3000
Added In: Hive 0.8 with HIVE-2127
The base waiting window (in milliseconds) before the next retry. The actual wait time is calculated by baseWindow * failures + baseWindow * (failure + 1) * (random number between 0.0,1.0).
hive.stats.collect.rawdatasize
Default Value: true
Added In: Hive 0.8 with HIVE-2185
If true, the raw data size is collected when analyzing tables.
hive.client.stats.publishers
Default Value: (empty)
Added In: Hive 0.8.1 with HIVE-2446 (patch 2)
Comma-separated list of statistics publishers to be invoked on counters on each job. A client stats publisher is specified as the name of a Java class which implements the org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.stats.ClientStatsPublisher interface.
hive.client.stats.counters
Default Value: (empty)
Added In: Hive 0.8.1 with HIVE-2446 (patch 2)
Subset of counters that should be of interest for hive.client.stats.publishers (when one wants to limit their publishing). Non-display names should be used.
hive.stats.reliable
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 0.10.0 with HIVE-1653
New Behavior In:  Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-3777
Whether queries will fail because statistics cannot be collected completely accurately. If this is set to true, reading/writing from/into a partition or unpartitioned table may fail because the statistics could not be computed accurately. If it is set to false, the operation will succeed.
In Hive 0.13.0 and later, if hive.stats.reliable is false and statistics could not be computed correctly, the operation can still succeed and update the statistics but it sets a partition property "areStatsAccurate" to false. If the application needs accurate statistics, they can then be obtained in the background.
hive.stats.ndv.error
Default Value: 20.0
Added In: Hive 0.10 with HIVE-1362 (patch 10)
Standard error allowed for NDV estimates, expressed in percentage. This provides a tradeoff between accuracy and compute cost. A lower value for the error indicates higher accuracy and a higher compute cost. (NDV means number of distinct values.)
hive.stats.collect.tablekeys
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 0.10 with HIVE-3501
Whether join and group by keys on tables are derived and maintained in the QueryPlan. This is useful to identify how tables are accessed and to determine if they should be bucketed.
hive.stats.collect.scancols
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 0.11 with HIVE-3940
Whether column accesses are tracked in the QueryPlan. This is useful to identify how tables are accessed and to determine if there are wasted columns that can be trimmed.
hive.stats.key.prefix.max.length
Default Value: 200 (Hive 0.11 and 0.12) or 150 (Hive 0.13 and later)
Added In: Hive 0.11 with HIVE-3750
Determines if, when the prefix of the key used for intermediate statistics collection exceeds a certain length, a hash of the key is used instead. If the value < 0 then hashing is never used, if the value >= 0 then hashing is used only when the key prefixes' length exceeds that value. The key prefix is defined as everything preceding the task ID in the key. For counter type statistics, it's maxed by mapreduce.job.counters.group.name.max, which is by default 128.
hive.stats.key.prefix.reserve.length
Default Value: 24
Added In: Hive 0.13 with HIVE-6229
Reserved length for postfix of statistics key. Currently only meaningful for counter type statistics which should keep the length of the full statistics key smaller than the maximum length configured by hive.stats.key.prefix.max.length. For counter type statistics, it should be bigger than the length of LB spec if exists.
hive.stats.max.variable.length
Default Value: 100
Added In: Hive 0.13 with HIVE-5369
To estimate the size of data flowing through operators in Hive/Tez (for reducer estimation etc.), average row size is multiplied with the total number of rows coming out of each operator. Average row size is computed from average column size of all columns in the row. In the absence of column statistics, for variable length columns (like string, bytes, etc.) this value will be used. For fixed length columns their corresponding Java equivalent sizes are used (float ¨C 4 bytes, double ¨C 8 bytes, etc.).
hive.analyze.stmt.collect.partlevel.stats
Default Value: true
Added In: Hive 0.14.0 with HIVE-7609
Prior to 0.14, on partitioned table, analyze statement used to collect table level statistics when no partition is specified. That behavior has changed beginning 0.14 to instead collect partition level statistics for all partitions. If old behavior of collecting aggregated table level statistics is desired, change the value of this config to false. This impacts only column statistics. Basic statistics are not impacted by this config.
hive.stats.list.num.entries
Default Value: 10
Added In: Hive 0.13 with HIVE-5369
To estimate the size of data flowing through operators in Hive/Tez (for reducer estimation etc.), average row size is multiplied with the total number of rows coming out of each operator. Average row size is computed from average column size of all columns in the row. In the absence of column statistics and for variable length complex columns like list, the average number of entries/values can be specified using this configuration property.
hive.stats.map.num.entries
Default Value: 10
Added In: Hive 0.13 with HIVE-5369
To estimate the size of data flowing through operators in Hive/Tez (for reducer estimation etc.), average row size is multiplied with the total number of rows coming out of each operator. Average row size is computed from average column size of all columns in the row. In the absence of column statistics and for variable length complex columns like map, the average number of entries/values can be specified using this configuration property.
hive.stats.map.parallelism
Default Value: 1
Added In: Hive 0.13 with HIVE-5369
Removed In: Hive 0.14 with HIVE-7156
The Hive/Tez optimizer estimates the data size flowing through each of the operators. For the GROUPBY operator, to accurately compute the data size map-side parallelism needs to be known. By default, this value is set to 1 since the optimizer is not aware of the number of mappers during compile-time. This Hive configuration property can be used to specify the number of mappers for data size computation of the GROUPBY operator. (This configuration property was removed in release 0.14.0.)
hive.stats.fetch.partition.stats
Default Value: true
Added In: Hive 0.13 with HIVE-6298
Annotation of the operator tree with statistics information requires partition level basic statistics like number of rows, data size and file size. Partition statistics are fetched from the metastore. Fetching partition statistics for each needed partition can be expensive when the number of partitions is high. This flag can be used to disable fetching of partition statistics from the metastore. When this flag is disabled, Hive will make calls to the filesystem to get file sizes and will estimate the number of rows from the row schema.
hive.stats.fetch.column.stats
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 0.13 with HIVE-5898
Annotation of the operator tree with statistics information requires column statistics. Column statistics are fetched from the metastore. Fetching column statistics for each needed column can be expensive when the number of columns is high. This flag can be used to disable fetching of column statistics from the metastore.
hive.stats.join.factor
Default Value: (float) 1.1
Added In: Hive 0.13 with HIVE-5921
The Hive/Tez optimizer estimates the data size flowing through each of the operators. The JOIN operator uses column statistics to estimate the number of rows flowing out of it and hence the data size. In the absence of column statistics, this factor determines the amount of rows flowing out of the JOIN operator.
hive.stats.deserialization.factor
Default Value: (float) 1.0
Added In: Hive 0.13 with HIVE-5921
The Hive/Tez optimizer estimates the data size flowing through each of the operators. In the absence of basic statistics like number of rows and data size, file size is used to estimate the number of rows and data size. Since files in tables/partitions are serialized (and optionally compressed) the estimates of number of rows and data size cannot be reliably determined. This factor is multiplied with the file size to account for serialization and compression.
hive.stats.avg.row.size
Default Value: 10000
Added In: Hive 0.13 with HIVE-5921
In the absence of table/partition statistics, average row size will be used to estimate the number of rows/data size.
hive.compute.query.using.stats
Default Value: false
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-5483
When set to true Hive will answer a few queries like min, max, and count(1) purely using statistics stored in the metastore. For basic statistics collection, set the configuration property hive.stats.autogather to true. For more advanced statistics collection, run ANALYZE TABLE queries.
hive.stats.gather.num.threads
Default Value: 10
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-6578
Number of threads used by partialscan/noscan analyze command for partitioned tables. This is applicable only for file formats that implement the StatsProvidingRecordReader interface (like ORC).

Changed in Hive 0.14.0 to include "list" and "reload" with HIVE-7592 ("list") and HIVE-7553 ("reload")
Comma separated list of non-SQL Hive commands that users are authorized to execute. This can be used to restrict the set of authorized commands. The supported command list is "set,reset,dfs,add,delete,compile" in Hive 0.13.0 or "set,reset,dfs,add,list,delete,reload,compile" starting in Hive 0.14.0 and by default all these commands are authorized. To restrict any of these commands, set hive.security.command.whitelist to a value that does not have the command in it.

Default Value: (empty)
Added In: Hive 0.7.0
The privileges automatically granted to some roles whenever a table gets created. An example like "roleX,roleY:select;roleZ:create" will grant select privilege to roleX and roleY, and grant create privilege to roleZ whenever a new table created.
hive.security.authorization.createtable.owner.grants
Default Value: (empty)
Added In: Hive 0.7.0
The privileges automatically granted to the owner whenever a table gets created. An example like "select,drop" will grant select and drop privilege to the owner of the table. Note that the default gives the creator of a table no access to the table.
Hive Metastore Security
Metastore-side security was added in Hive 0.10.0 (HIVE-3705).  For more information, see the overview in Authorization and details in Storage Based Authorization in the Metastore Server.
For general metastore configuration properties, see MetaStore.
hive.metastore.pre.event.listeners
Default Value: (empty)
Added In: Hive 0.9.0 with HIVE-2853
The pre-event listener classes to be loaded on the metastore side to run code whenever databases, tables, and partitions are created, altered, or dropped. Set this configuration property to org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.security.authorization.AuthorizationPreEventListener in hive-site.xml to turn on Hive metastore-side security.
hive.security.metastore.authorization.manager
Default Value: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.security.authorization.DefaultHiveMetastoreAuthorizationProvider
Added In: Hive 0.10.0 with HIVE-3705; revised in Hive 0.14.0 with HIVE-7209
Hive 0.13 and earlier:  The authorization manager class name to be used in the metastore for authorization. The user-defined authorization class should implement interface org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.security.authorization.HiveMetastoreAuthorizationProvider.
Hive 0.14 and later:  Names of authorization manager classes (comma separated) to be used in the metastore for authorization. User-defined authorization classes should implement interface org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.security.authorization.HiveMetastoreAuthorizationProvider. All authorization manager classes have to successfully authorize the metastore API call for the command execution to be allowed.
The DefaultHiveMetastoreAuthorizationProvider implements the standard Hive grant/revoke model. A storage-based authorization implementation is also provided to use as the value of this configuration property:
org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.security.authorization.StorageBasedAuthorizationProvider
which uses HDFS permissions to provide authorization instead of using Hive-style grant-based authorization.
hive.security.metastore.authenticator.manager
Default Value: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.security.HadoopDefaultMetastoreAuthenticator
Added In: Hive 0.10.0 with HIVE-3705
The authenticator manager class name to be used in the metastore for authentication. The user-defined authenticator class should implement interface org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.security.HiveAuthenticationProvider.
hive.security.metastore.authorization.auth.reads

If this is true, the metastore authorizer authorizes read actions on database and table. See Storage Based Authorization.
hive.metastore.token.signature
Default Value: "" (empty string)
Added in Hive 0.7.0, added to HiveConf in Hive 2.1.0
The delegation token service name to match when selecting a token from the current user's tokens.
SQL Standard Based Authorization
Version
Hive 0.13.0 introduces fine-grained authorization based on the SQL standard authorization model. This is still a work in progress ¨C see HIVE-5837 for the functional specification and list of subtasks.
hive.users.in.admin.role
Default Value: (empty)
Added In: Hive 0.13.0 with HIVE-5959

A comma separated list of configuration properties that users are authorized to set when SQL standard base authorization is used.
If this parameter is not set, the default list is added by the SQL standard authorizer. To display the default list for the current release, use the command 'set hive.security.authorization.sqlstd.confwhitelist'.
In Hive 0.13.0 the default white list has these properties (see HIVE-6846 for the same list arranged one property per line):
hive.exec.reducers.bytes.per.reducer, hive.exec.reducers.max, hive.map.aggr, hive.map.aggr.hash.percentmemory, hive.map.aggr.hash.force.flush.memory.threshold, hive.map.aggr.hash.min.reduction, hive.groupby.skewindata, hive.optimize.multigroupby.common.distincts, hive.optimize.index.groupby, hive.optimize.ppd, hive.optimize.ppd.storage, hive.ppd.recognizetransivity, hive.optimize.groupby, hive.optimize.sort.dynamic.partition, hive.optimize.union.remove, hive.multigroupby.singlereducer, hive.map.groupby.sorted, hive.map.groupby.sorted.testmode, hive.optimize.skewjoin, hive.optimize.skewjoin.compiletime, hive.mapred.mode, hive.enforce.bucketmapjoin, hive.exec.compress.output, hive.exec.compress.intermediate, hive.exec.parallel, hive.exec.parallel.thread.number, hive.exec.rowoffset, hive.merge.mapfiles, hive.merge.mapredfiles, hive.merge.tezfiles, hive.ignore.mapjoin.hint, hive.auto.convert.join, hive.auto.convert.join.noconditionaltask, hive.auto.convert.join.noconditionaltask.size, hive.auto.convert.join.use.nonstaged, hive.enforce.bucketing, hive.enforce.sorting, hive.enforce.sortmergebucketmapjoin, hive.auto.convert.sortmerge.join, hive.execution.engine, hive.vectorized.execution.enabled, hive.mapjoin.optimized.keys, hive.mapjoin.lazy.hashtable, hive.exec.check.crossproducts, hive.compat, hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode, mapred.reduce.tasks, mapred.output.compression.codec, mapred.map.output.compression.codec, mapreduce.job.reduce.slowstart.completedmaps, mapreduce.job.queuename.
Hive 0.14.0 adds new parameters to the default white list (see HIVE-8534) and Hive 1.2.0 and 1.2.1 add more new parameters (see HIVE-10578, HIVE-10678, and HIVE-10967). Some parameters are added automatically when they match one of the regex specifications for the white list in HiveConf.java (for example, hive.log.trace.id in release 2.0.0 ¨C see HIVE-12419).
Note that the hive.conf.restricted.list checks are still enforced after the white list check.
hive.server2.builtin.udf.whitelist
Default Value: Empty (treated as not set ¨C all UDFs allowed)
Added In: Hive 1.1.0 with HIVE-8893
A comma separated list of builtin UDFs that are allowed to be executed. A UDF that is not included in the list will return an error if invoked from a query. If set to empty, then treated as wildcard character ¨C all UDFs will be allowed. Note that this configuration is read at the startup time by HiveServer2 and changing this using a 'set' command in a session won't change the behavior.
hive.server2.builtin.udf.blacklist
Default Value: Empty
Added In: Hive 1.1.0 with HIVE-8893
A comma separated list of builtin UDFs that are not allowed to be executed. A UDF that is included in the list will return an error if invoked from a query.  Note that this configuration is read at the startup time by HiveServer2 and changing this using a 'set' command in a session won't change the behavior.
hive.security.authorization.task.factory
Default Value: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.parse.authorization.HiveAuthorizationTaskFactoryImpl
Added In: Hive 1.1.0 with HIVE-8611
To override the default authorization DDL handling, set hive.security.authorization.task.factory to a class that implements the org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.parse.authorization.HiveAuthorizationTaskFactory interface.

(This configuration property was removed in release 0.10.0.)
Locking
See Hive Concurrency Model for general information about locking.
hive.support.concurrency

Regions
Reverted by HIVE-2612 in Hive 0.9.0
The configuration properties that used to be documented in this section (hive.use.input.primary.region, hive.default.region.name, and hive.region.properties) existed temporarily in trunk before Hive release 0.9.0 but they were removed before the release. See HIVE-2612 and HIVE-2965.
Apologies for any confusion caused by their former inclusion in this document.
